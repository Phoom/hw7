# Twitter Analysis on Media Sources (Last 100 Tweets)

- It can be inferred that a majority of tweets from each station are neutral. There is a large number of tweets on the scatterplot that follows the center point (at 0).


- Despite some neutrality among stations - CBS seems to have more positive tweets than any other stations. The bar plot for CBS tops the highest at 0.332, followed by BBC at 0.179.


- Besides the neutrality among stations on the scatterplot, there is no clear or discernible patter for the last 100 tweets from each station. 


- Limitations to note: 
    - This analysis is only applicable to this point in time - as any "big" news can quickly swing the values in the plot around. 
    - VADER analysis is limited - it does not deal well with ambiguous or sarcastic text. 
    - There is also quite a few of texts that has unique emoticons (which pandas/VADER cannot properly read here), which could heavily influence how the text could be interpreted
